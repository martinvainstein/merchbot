# merchbot
This project is a **Python 3.12** bot that monitors one or more web pages for **new or available merchandise** (e.g., a band’s merch on a clothing brand’s website).   It runs in the background on macOS via `launchd` and sends **Telegram** notifications as soon as availability is detected.
